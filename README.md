### US Bikeshare Data
In this project Python is used to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington.

### Description
Once the program is run, you will be asked the following questions:
- Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York, or Washington?
- Would you like to filter the data by month, day, or not at all?
Once selected, some core stats about the bike share data will be shown. 

### Files used
Bike Share Data is required, which is contained in the following files: 
- chicago.csv
- new_york_city.csv
- washington.csv
These files can be found inside the Ressources in "Programming for Data Science with Python" inside the "Introduction to Python" Project.

### Credits
I would like to express my gratitude to Udacity for providing valuable resources that contributed to the development of this project.
